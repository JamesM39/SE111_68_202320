                <p><b>James Maughan</b> is from <i>Idaho Falls, Idaho</i> where he lived for 14 years. <b>James</b> spends most of his free time <i>playing</i> <u>video games</u>, <u>board games</u>, and <u>tabletop RPGs</u>. When not engaged in any of the previous activities he can be found <i>watching</i> <u>documentaries</u> and <i>reading</i> <u>nonfiction books</u> on all subjects but he is especially fond of <i>history, technology, and philosophy</i>. He spent most of his <i>teenage years</i> <u>volunteering</u> with a local teen volunteer group and later went on to work there part time. <b>James</b> got his <i>GED</i> at the age of <u>16</u> because of how much he disliked school. After an unsuccessful attempt at college only several months later he swore he was done with school, but life doesnâ€™t always go as planned, and he is now attending <em><i>New England Institute of Technology</i></em> to obtain a degree in <u>cybersecurity</u>.</p>
