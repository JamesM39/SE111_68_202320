            <br>

            <p>The TV show <em>Firefly</em> is a space western, set in the far future where most people are just doing what they can to get by. Throughout the show you see many groups of people including the protagonists doing morally questionable things to get by. I would say that is one of the shows main themes looking at what people are willing to do to survive. There are no good guys, it's all gray. At the end of the first episode, Shepherd Book (shepherd being the term for a preacher) says <em>"I've been out of the abbey, two days, I've beaten a lawman senseless, I've fallen in with criminals. I watched the captain shoot the man I swore to protect. And I'm not even sure if I think he was wrong."</em> In a lot of ways, even though it's set in space 500 years from now, it's very similar to our own world.</p>

            <br>

            <p><em>Firefly</em> is very good show. All of its characters are extremely well developed, and while at first glance it's universe may seem kind of generic there is a surprising amount of detail put into it. Unfortunately despite all it's potential it was canceled after a single season. All the fans got for closure was an extremely rushed movie that honestly sucks. Although it does also have a few graphic novels about side stories which are pretty good. At the end of the day I would absolutely recommend <em>Firefly</em> to everyone particularly those that are interested in sci-fi, westerns, or moral complexity.</p>
